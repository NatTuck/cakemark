Cakemark benchmarks are built and run by a series of standard "make"
targets. Behavior is modified using standard environment variables.

Environment Variables:

 - OPENCL specifies which OpenCL implementation to use. Sample values
   are "pocl" for standard POCL, "cake" for specializing POCL, and
   "amd" for AMD OpenCL (CPU target).
 - CAKE_TIMINGS sets the file name where timings will be output.

Make targets:

 - "make all" builds the benchmark binary.
 - "make test" runs the benchmark binary.
 - "make bench" cleans, builds, and runs the benchmark binary.

To be helpful, benchmarks must also:
    
 - Have specialization annotations for an OpenCL kernel.
 - Check the result of that kernel for correctness and output that
   information in a form suitable for automatic validation.
